                    <h2 id='1'>Why Should you Visit Delhi?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Despite its less than wonderful reputation as a travel destination, to miss out on visiting Delhi during a
                        trip to India would be a bit of a sin. There are plenty of reasons to given India's capital a chance, from
                        its food, to its lush parks in the south of the city, to its mish-mash of cultures and languages that
                        represent the varied tapestry that the sub-continent of India covers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Delhi is a summary of all that India is - from its super modern metro to its crumbling havelis
                        (historic stately homes), from its dusty spice markets to its gleaming and luxurious shopping malls.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But if there's one reason that stands out most to us as a reason to visit, it's Delhi's history. Delhi is
                        one of the longest-serving capitals in the world, and has witnessed the rise and fall of empires. A walk
                        through Delhi can take you past monuments from the late 1100s to the present day, in a city heavily influenced
                        by the Mughals, the British and many others.

                    <h2 id='2'>Essential New Delhi Travel Tips - Know Before you Go</h2>        
                    <p>
                        Delhi is the entry point to India for so many visitors, and yet despite its charms, it is not the easiest
                        place to arrive in India. Touts and con-artists are used to tourists who've just arrived in the city - it's
                        not something to be nervous about, but more a reason to do your research and use common sense.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here are some of our tried and tested Delhi travel tips for newcomers.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If you're staying in a mid-range or upscale hotel (which is a good idea), arrange an airport pickup
                            directly with them for a smooth landing (more tips on airport transportation below).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you're flying long-haul, build in some time to rest and take it easy - Delhi can be overwhelming,
                            especially when you're tired.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Organise a tour for your first day in Delhi - Helps you to get your bearings and ease in to the
                            pace of Delhi with the comfort of someone showing you around. (Book tours via reputable companies
                            with good reviews, we don't recommend using the guides loitering outside famous monuments in Delhi).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Just after Diwali is not the ideal time to visit Delhi. Every year, the city gets covered in toxic smog.
                            It's better to visit later in the winter if you can.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The key with Delhi is to be cautious but not paranoid - hold your head up high, walk like you know
                            where you're going, and you'll likely find people leave you alone!
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        Arriving in Delhi
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Many of us arrive in India's capital under cover of darkness - that is to say that many
                        inter-continental flights arrive in the small hours of the morning. Fortunately the immigration
                        process seems to be much quicker than it used to be - if you have an E-visa, head straight to
                        the far end for quicker processing. In the arrivals hall is where the fun begins.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="sub-3">Tips for Avoiding the Airport Scams</h4> 
                    <p>
                        For travel from the airport, <b> I do not </b> recommend taking a regular pre-paid taxi
                        (and definitely ignore anyone that approaches you offering a taxi or ride).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The “your hotel has burnt down / is closed / Delhi is closed due to smog” (yes, really) scam is
                        still going as strong as ever, and revolves around taking unwitting travellers to a remote location
                        in the middle of the night, claiming not being able to find your hotel, and instead taking you to
                        one that pays commission. Or worse.
                    </p> 
                    
                    <h4 class="sub-3">Safe Transport Options from Delhi Airport</h4>
                    <p>
                        One of the best options for a safe transfer from the airport is to have your hotel arrange a transfer.
                        Make sure they'll be inside the terminal with a sign with the hotel's name, or with a “password” and
                        check their identity carefully before leaving with your driver or ask them for your names to be sure
                        they're the real deal and not just a random person with a sign.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="http://sakhaconsultingwings.com/">Sakha Cabs</a>, powered by <b>Women on Wheels</b> offer transfers and taxi services for women travellers, by women
                        drivers. The Azad Foundation behind the Women on Wheels initiative started it in Delhi in 2008 to bring
                        economic empowerment to women by enabling them to become professional drivers. Do your bit to support
                        them by arranging an airport transfer with them!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If that fails, use Meru cabs from New Delhi Airport while travelling alone in Delhi - there's a
                        separate desk for them when exiting arrivals. They're a little more expensive than regular cabs but
                        that's more reliable and safe.

                    <h2 id="4">The Best Way to Get Around Delhi.</h2>
                    <p>
                        Prepare to jump a few hundred years as you step from bustling Old Delhi into the New Delhi Metro - our
                        recommended way to travel around Delhi during daytime.
                        <br><br>
                        At night, its better to travel around Taxi / Uber / Ola for mixed groups.
                        <br><br>
                        The super fast and efficient Delhi Metro is a great (and cheap) way to get around the city and there's a
                        ladies carriage at the front of each train (solo ladies - use it!).
                        <br><br>
                        For short hops (auto)rickshaws / “tuktuks” are useful - in Delhi Rickshaw Wallahs seem to have universally
                        forgotten what the meter is so you'll have to negotiate. Expect to pay 50 Rupees for a short hop, and more
                        for longer rides. I love to open up the Uber app to get an idea of the going rate for an Uber and then use
                        that price to negotiate with the rickshaw guys. I do not recommend taking a rickshaw for solo ladies at night.
                        <br><br>
                        Uber itself has been involved in some scandals in Delhi, and personally I try to avoid Uber due to their
                        (un)ethical policies - an Indian alternative is the OLA app, which is a good way to pre-book rickshaws and
                        arrange taxis for the evening. 
                        <br><br>
                        If a rickshaw driver offers you a free ride or offers to take you to a friend's shop then the trip will
                        certainly involve stop offs at stores that pay commission to the driver. Best avoided, unless you are up
                        for some uncompetitively priced shopping..

                    <p>
                        There are plenty of things to do in Delhi to make you want to extend your stay - from exploring the
                        city's tombs and Mughal architecture, to the bungalows of Lutyens, to exploring bazaars, to sipping
                        world class cocktails in trendy bars.
                    </p>

                                You can't visit Delhi without seeing it's historic heart, winding lanes and the Jameh Masjid
                                (Mosque). We recommend taking a guided walking tour of this area to take in Chandni Chowk, the
                                Spice Market, Mosque and Red Fort. If it's your first day or two in India, you might want to go
                                easy on the street food in this area of Delhi - it can be delicious, but doesn't always go down
                                the best with un-acclimatised stomachs!

                                    In our opinion, well worth a visit although it is a mirror of the Fort at Agra, and the Delhi
                                    version receives fewer visitors. There are some great views over to the Fort from the Jameh
                                    Masjid. The Red Fort is included in many Old Delhi walking/tuk-tuk tours.

                                here wandering the grounds and enjoying the structure - for fewer crowds & better photos come
                                early in the morning.

                                with the Gateway of India in Mumbai!) and gaze down the Rajpath towards the government of India.
                                The India Gate is illuminated in the evenings between around 7pm and 9pm.

                    <p>
                        Despite some of the tourist scams and hustle, Delhi is one of the best places for experiencing all
                        that India has to offer. For best results, get up early to see Delhi's sites in the magical morning
                        light, complete with plenty of birds. Delhi gets uncomfortably hot outside of winter months (and
                        surprisingly cold during winter!) so be sure to check the weather and pack accordingly.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Last but not least, relax and enjoy the scene.
